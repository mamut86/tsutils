\title{Test a time series for trend}
\usage{
trendtest(
  y,
  extract = c("FALSE", "TRUE"),
  type = c("aicc", "cs"),
  mta = c(FALSE, TRUE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a time series that must be of either \code{ts} or \code{msts} class.}

\item{extract}{if \code{TRUE} then the centred moving average of the time series is calculated and the test is performed on that. Otherwise, the test is performed on the raw data.}

\item{type}{type of test. Can be:
\itemize{
\item \code{"aicc"}: test by comparing the AICc of exponential smoothing models. See details.
\item \code{"cs"}: test by using the Cox-Stuart test. See details.<
}}

\item{mta}{If \code{TRUE} augment testing by using Multiple Temporal Aggregation.}
}
\value{
The function returns \code{TRUE} when there is evidence of trend and \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Test a time series for trend by either fitting exponential smoothing models and comparing then using the AICc, or by using the non-parametric Cox-Stuart test. The tests can be augmented by using multiple temporal aggregation.
}
\details{
All tests are performed at 5% significance level. When exponential smoothing is used the following three models are compared: ETS(A,N,N), ETS(A,A,N), ETS(A,Ad,N).

\examples{
trendtest(referrals,TRUE)
